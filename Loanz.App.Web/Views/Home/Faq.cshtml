                                Peer to peer lending is a way to allow people to borrow money from other people - their peers. What distinguishes a peer to peer network is that there is no middle man, in this case a bank. Transactions are done between the person looking for a loan and the person willing to provide the loan. At LOANZ, our job is to bring together borrowers and lenders in a confidential and secure environment where people can safely and confidently apply for, obtain adn the pay loans.

        In many cases this is because they are unable to get a loan at an attractive rate from their local banks. Since the financial crisis, credit has tightened, and banks are demanding more from prospective borrowers. In a sense, banks are in a position to cheery pick the best borrowers, leaving many underserved. These underserved may not be high risk borrowers. In fact, many are not. Many are small businesses trying to expand or people working on their own that do not have a credit history or W2 wages. Peer to peer lending is perfectly suited to these people, providing a variety of loans that can help them get on their feet, cover those extra expenses or even take that long deserved vacation.

                                    LOANZ investors believe lending direct to consumers, without a middle man, provides them an opportunity to get a greater return on their investment. They could give their money to Wall Street, however they pay for that privilege which eats into their returns. By going direct there are no fees to pay the banks and they have control over the types of loans to invest in - form low risk, low return loans to high risk, high return loans.

        We look at everything from your working history and size of loan, to your current credit score and amount of debt. We don't' stop there though, these are just the hard numbers that everyone uses, including banks. At LOANZ, we also implement a number of "soft" metrics which further refine your LOANZ score. These are metrics propietary and tailored to the LOANZ underwriting method and ensure that we look at the person, not the number.

        We take care of that for you. When you apply for a loan, you provide your bank account information to receive the cash, and also allow LOANZ to deduct payments twice a month. These payments will be automatically deducted from your account until the loan has been fully repaid. It is important that you budget your cash flow accordingly to avoid any missed payments.

        First off, don't panic. Call us at LOANZ and we'll walk through what happened and how we can prevent it from occurring in the future. If you do miss a payment, you will be charged a penalty fee that will be added to your next payment. If you miss two payments, you will be connected with one of our payment specialists who will work with you to help get spending and payments back under control. If you miss a total of four consecutive payments, then we pass the loan onto a collection agency who will be tasked with getting the loan repaid. No-one wants this to happen.
